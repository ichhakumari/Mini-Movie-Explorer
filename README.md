## Mini Movie Explorer â€“ Project Overview & Approach

### Overview
Mini Movie Explorer is a responsive, single-page web application that allows users to:
- Search movies using the OMDb API

- Filter by genre with live updates

Built using HTML, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript, the project demonstrates clean UI/UX and interactive user features without the need for a backend.
